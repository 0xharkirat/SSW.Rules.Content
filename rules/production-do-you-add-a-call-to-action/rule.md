<p>Without a call to action prompting viewers to do something at the end of a video, the purpose of the video is lost. As such, make sure you include the call to action at the end.​<br></p>
Common objectives are to&#58;<ul>
<li>Obtain the viewer's email address</li>
<li>Get the viewer to provide info and request a service from the company​</li><li>Get them to subscribe to&#160;the company's social media pages<br></li></ul>
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<p>A good 'call to action' should&#58;</p><ol><li>Be short (no more than 30 seconds).</li><li>Not have too many options -&#160;a&#160;visitor is much more likely to do a task if he's not confused by being given dozens of&#160;social media options.</li><li>(Optionally) Tell them they get value.&#160;E.g. if they comment they will make a difference.</li><li>If you have a paid subscription offering or a free one like YouTube) give incentives to subscribe now, along with the benefits subscribed users get.</li><li>Remember that people have different preferences for social media. You pretty much need to cover your bases. Have a Twitter page, Facebook page, LinkedIn account, YouTube channel, etc. Of course, don't have all these in the 'call to action', but make sure that those options are easily accessible.</li><li>If you are using YouTube or another service that provides the option to have annotations, use annotations that prompt the viewer to comment or subscribe. A 'subscribe' link&#160;in the annotation&#160;gets more subscribers</li></ol><div><div class="ssw-rteStyle-GreyBox">Thanks, have a good one!</div>

      </dt><dd>Figure&#58; Good Example – very clear call to action that asks for&#160;an email address. Only asks for one thing at a time and uses zooming effects. In addition, gives a twitter option to engage&#160;and uses live-action​<br></dd></dl>
