â€‹Windows has a built-in storage solution called <b>Storage Spaces</b> that allows you to group 3 or more storage drives to create a bigger pool; however, that technology, whilst useful, has some better third-party contenders like <b>Drive Bender</b>, which does the same thing better and faster.<br>
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<p>With <b>Drive Bender</b>, you also have software RAID, disk grouping, and file duplication that you find in Storage Spaces, but with a better interface and faster transfer rates.<br></p><h3>Drive Bender Pros<br></h3><ol><li>Nice UI with lots of functionality<br></li><li>Regular updates</li><li>Heaps of configuration options</li><li>Friendly (and fast!) customer support (Bonus: They are located in Sydney, Australia, just like SSW! ðŸ˜ƒ)</li><li>Easy add and remove of drives to the pool</li><li>Check your disk health automatically</li><li>Get notifications on pool status<br></li></ol><h3>Drive Bender Consâ€‹<br></h3><ol><li>Storage Spaces is "free" (built-in in Windows Server), Drive Bender is $54.95 for 3 machines (still cheap, forever)<br></li></ol><div>
