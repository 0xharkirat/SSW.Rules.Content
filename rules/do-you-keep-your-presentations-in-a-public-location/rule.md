<p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">​Most companies keep their presentations on an internal resource eg. SharePoint ... these days more likely Teams | Files ....and there is still a place for that (especially if you don't want to share it).​​<br></p><p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">The best place for presentations (PPT) and other resources such as PDFs or a bunch of URLs is in a public location. The best public location is GitHub.</p><p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">​Did you know that&#160;if you keep your PowerPoint&#160;presentations in a public location, it makes it easier for your attendees to access later?<br></p>
