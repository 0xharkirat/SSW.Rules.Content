<p>Sometimes the person you send your email to may not reply immediately because they're busy or just may have forgotten about it.&#160; If you need an answer, use a RESEND by doing the following&#58;</p>
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<ol>
<li>Reply to ALL&#160; 
<li>Put (RESEND) in 1<sup>st</sup> line of the Body 
<li>Plus any other instructions - such as &quot;Hurry Up!&quot; </li></ol><span class="ms-rteCustom-ImageArea"><img border="0" alt="Hurry Up" src="/Standards/Communication/RulesToBetterEmail/PublishingImages/HurryUp.gif" /></span><span class="ms-rteCustom-FigureGood">Figure&#58; This is an example of a RESEND.</span> 
<p>This reminds the other person that you are still waiting for a response.</p>
