According to <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/ms997609%28v=msdn.10%29">Design Specifications and Guidelines - User Assistance</a>, the commands for navigating through a wizard should be "&lt; Back" and "Next &gt;".

<span>  
   <p>When your site needs a link to iterate backward​ through records we recommend that you use "&lt; Back" instead of "&lt; Previous". </p> 
   <p>There are a few reasons for this:</p> 
   <ol><li>This is the standard used in Microsoft Installation files. MSIs are the most widely used installation package available today. </li><li>Internet Explorer and several other lesser-known browsers use a Back button to iterate back through webpages, so your visitors will automatically know what your "&lt; Back" link does. </li><li>It is important to keep consistency on your pages. </li></ol> 
   <p>Below is an example of a Good "&lt; Back" link versus some Bad variations.</p>

         <img width="226" height="41" src="badpreviouslink.gif" alt="Bad" /> 
      </dt><dd>Figure: This is Bad because it says "Previous" instead of "Back" </dd></dl> 
   <dl class="badImage"><dt>
         <img width="154" height="40" src="badbacklink.gif" alt="Good" /> 
      </dt><dd>Figure: This is bad because it has too many "&lt;"s or it has no space between the "&lt;" and the "Back" </dd></dl> 
   
   <dl class="goodImage"><dt>
         <img width="420" height="88" src="textboxeswithshowbutton.gif" alt="Good" />
