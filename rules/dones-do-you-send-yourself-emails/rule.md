<p>When a colleague or a client asks you to do a task verbally, or you have discovered there’s a task you need to do but don’t have time to do it immediately, what method do you have for remembering to do it?<br></p><p>The best solution is to send yourself an email CC'ing the person who asked you, including "<a id="AsPerConversationEmail" href="/Pages/DoYouAlwaysSendAnAsPerOurConversationEmail.aspx" target="_blank" shape="rect">As per our conversation</a>..." This way both of you know that the job needs to be done. This is really important especially when you are working for clients so there is a record of the requests for work.​<br></p>
