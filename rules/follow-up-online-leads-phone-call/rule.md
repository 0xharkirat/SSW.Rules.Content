When users fill out an online form to make a booking request, it's common for businesses to collect basic contact details. Unfortunately, many online forms neglect to ask for a phone number. This oversight can lead to missed opportunities for follow-up or converting a lead into a customer.

By collecting phone numbers and following up with a phone call, you can significantly increase your chances of converting online leads into customers. Make sure your forms are designed to gather all necessary contact information, and prioritize personal, immediate follow-ups to build trust and engagement with your prospects.

This does not apply for online forms designed for marketing purposes. Research indicates that online marketing forms, such as offering a free ebook, that request a phone number in addition to an email address, can negatively affect the form's completion rate. It is generally advised to keep these forms short and request only an email address. To ensure these marketing forms comply with [consent laws](https://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy/your-privacy-rights/your-personal-information/consent-to-the-handling-of-personal-information), they need to include a separate, clear consent checkbox (not pre-checked) to allow a person to opt in for further communications.

Making phone numbers optional on forms can improve user experience and increase the chances of form completion. Here are some key benefits:

* **Increased Completion Rates**: Users are more likely to complete forms if they are not forced to provide their phone number
* **Better User Experience**: Users appreciate the flexibility and respect for their privacy
* **Higher Engagement**: Optional phone numbers can lead to higher engagement as users feel more comfortable sharing information

## The importance of phone follow-ups

Following up with a phone call can dramatically increase the likelihood of converting a lead into a customer. A phone call adds a personal touch, builds trust, and allows for immediate engagement and clarification. In fact, a majority of sales are completed over the phone, highlighting the importance of this method.

### Key points

* **Instant connection:** A phone call provides a direct line to the prospect, allowing you to answer questions and address concerns in real-time
* **Personal touch:** Hearing a human voice can create a more personal connection than an email or text message
* **Immediate feedback:** You can gauge the prospect's interest and adjust your approach based on their responses

### Boost your sales teamâ€™s proficiency

Train your sales team to **prioritize phone calls when following up with leads**. Here are some important elements to focus on for training sales teams to make effective follow-ups via phone calls:

* **Script development:** Structured call scripts provide salespeople with key talking points and responses to common objections, ensuring consistency and effectiveness in communication
* **Role-playing exercises:** These simulate real-life scenarios and help salespeople practice and refine their pitch and response skills, preparing them for actual calls
* **CRM utilization:** Training on how to use CRM tools effectively helps sales teams track interactions, set reminders, and access customer data, ensuring timely and informed follow-ups
* **Personalization techniques:** Encouraging personalization of follow-up messages based on previous interactions makes the communication more relevant and engaging for prospects
