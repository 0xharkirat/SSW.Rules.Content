Consider the situation where you jump in an elevator and start chatting to the other person and they ask *"What does your product do?"*

There is probably under 60 seconds to give an answer that will excite them about your product.

<!--endintro-->

This "elevator pitch" scenario can happen when you meet a new client, at an event, when you're at a barbecue with a friend. The more effort you put into doing your pitch well, the better you will sound.

Although not everybody is in sales, we all will have opportunities to influence others at different times.

## How to form a pitch for a product

To form a pitch, it is important to collate your thoughts about the product. Consider these areas:

1. The what
2. The unique value
3. Call to action

### 1. The what

Think about what your product is, focus on the problem it solves. For example:

* TinaCMS is a Headless CMS where your content is stored as Markdown in GitHub

**Tip:** You might have 15 great points, but start the conversation with a couple of important ones. Consider who you are speaking to when choosing the highest value points.

### 2. The unique value

Now think about what your product does and its competitors don't - things that make your product special. For example:

* GitHub enables version control and great approval workflow
* It has a great editing UX

### 3. The call to action

Think about where people would go to get more information or to buy the product. For example:

* To learn more check out the demo on the website [tina.io](https://tina.io)

## Practice your product pitch

Now you have a few bullet points, go outside and record a quick video from memory. Here's a few tips to get it right:

* **Hook people in** - Make sure to mention the question at the start, so people have a little context
* **Practice and perfect it** - Do a few takes until it feels right

There you go, that's your product pitch!
