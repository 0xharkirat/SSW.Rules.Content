Organizations are extremely good at accumulating data. Mostly in the form of documents and records, this data is often haphazardly located across the organization, and poorly integrated into document processes.

SharePoint is the best organization tool to improve this situation by storing all documents & records in a centralized system. SharePoint stores every version of a document, allows you to enforce information management policies and improves efficiency by automating common business processes. Here you will find many rules for a better experience with SharePoint.
