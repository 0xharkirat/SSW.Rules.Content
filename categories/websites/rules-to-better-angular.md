Angular is everywhere.

There are two distinctive versions of Angular:

* AngularJS, this is v1, not getting any new features, and ends LTS support at the end of 2021
* **Angular** (or Angular 2+) which represents any version of Angular after 2.0 (which was a major rewrite).

This page is a set of rules and guidelines to get you up and running using Angular with the least pain possible.

A lot of these rules have originated from the [Angular Superpowers Tour](https://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Events/Training/Angular-Superpowers-Tour.aspx).

Angular and React have been the 2 dominant front-end technologies for the last few years. We have been running our Angular Superpowers course that entire time, and it is still amazing that every time we run the course, we sell out. 

Of course, we update the course with every version, but it's still amazing because JavaScript frameworks have a reputation for being transitory. But these 2 frameworks have become entrenched in enterprises everywhere.
