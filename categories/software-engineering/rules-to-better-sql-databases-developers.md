Here are some of the typical things that all SQL Server DBAs and Database developers should know. These rules are above and beyond the most basic textbook recommendations of:

* Ensuring your databases are Normalized and in 3rd Normal Form
* Making sure you have primary keys, foreign keys and simple indexes to improve performance
* Making sure you Back up regularly
* Basic Naming conventions (see some of our object naming conventions)
* Minimizing result set sizes and data over the wire
