In the video **Twitter Bootstrap & ASP.NET MVC - Intro / Quickstart**, Ben Cull walks us through Bootstrap, how it impacts your development experience and how to get the most out of it to produce functional and visually pleasing solutions.

**Note:** There's been syntax changes in Bootstrap versions from when this was recorded. Example: In the video what was written: `col-md-offset` ...is currently written `offset-col-md` (according to the Bootstrap 5 docs).
