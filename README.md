# SSW.Rules (content) 


- Each rule has a markdown file and a corresponding folder for images ans assets
- Rules are organised into categories
- A rule can belong to multiple categories
- category pages limnk to rules via frontmatter data
- rules are placed into folders based on year of initial creation.
- This folder organisation is not semantic - just used to make the mumber of rules in an individual folder more manageable
